@ControllerAdvice is a specialization of the @Component annotation which allows to handle exceptions across the whole application in one global handling
 component.
 It can be viewed as an interceptor of exceptions thrown by methods annotated with @RequestMapping and
 	@ExceptionHandler({ RuntimeException.class, NullPointerException.class })
	@ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
	@ExceptionHandler(SQLException.class)
	@ExceptionHandler(MultipartException.class)

Hystrix is a library that controls the interaction between microservices to provide latency and fault tolerance. Additionally, it makes sense to modify the 
UI to let the user know that something might not have worked as expected or would take more time.
 
Zuul Server is a gateway application that handles all the requests and does the dynamic routing of microservice applications.
 The Zuul Server is also known as Edge Server.
For Example, /api/user is mapped to the user service and /api/products is mapped to the product service and
 Zuul Server dynamically routes the requests to the respective backend application.
@EnableZuulProxy in gateway microservice

Eureka Server is an application that holds the information about all client-service applications. Every Micro service will register into the Eureka server 
and Eureka server knows all the client applications running on each port and IP address. Eureka Server is also known as Discovery Server.
@EnableEurekaServer in gateway application.,

@EurekaClient Every microservice name with @EurekaClient will registered to the gateway eureka server . SO each microservice will annotate with @EurekaClient

The circuit breaker we can define the threshold value for the number of failures between the microservices.
The proxy will monitor the failue count and stops the request sending for the specific amount of time if the failure count exceeds the threshold limit.
After the timeout tit again send the limited amount of request to hit if succeed then normal flow continues

Closed State -  Default is the closd state.If the failure request count exceeds the  thresholdvalue in specific time the circuit breaker will move to open state.
Open state -  Blocks the communication between the microservices and the send microservice will receive an exception from the circuit breaker
Half open state - circuit breaker will allow limited no of request. if request success then back to close state . if not then it block for certain amount of time.


Spring Batch provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, 
transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management.

1) JDBC Driver is a software component that enables java application to interact with the database. there are four types of jdbc driver
   we used - com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
2)DriverManagerDataSource - Set the JDBC driver class name. This driver will get initialized on startup, registering itself with the JDK's DriverManager. 
  NOTE: DriverManagerDataSource is primarily intended for accessing pre-registered JDBC drivers. If you need to register a new driver,
  consider using SimpleDriverDataSource instead.

3) Methods Of Transaction Management or transaction tyoes. #1) setAutoCommit() Method. #2) Commit() Method. #3) Rollback() Method. #4) setSavepoint() Method. #5) releaseSavepoint() Method.
   setAutoCommit(true); enables auto-commit mode, which means that each statement is once again committed automatically when it is completed
   The Commit(false) ensures all the successful execution of statement. If any of them not execute, the whole process gets failed.
   Rollback() method reverse all the changes that is made by current connection.
